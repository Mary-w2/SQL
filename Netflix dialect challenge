--Welcome to my first posted portfolio using PostgreSQL. Using a different dialect was an 
--extra challenge to keep everything straight, especially quotes! I used a data set with 8870 rows
--provided by Charlotte Chaze at https://breakintotech.teachable.com/courses/da-launch/lectures/38267857.

--#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows) 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie';

--#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database? 
SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

--#4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star? 
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" t
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" p
ON t.show_id = p.show_id
WHERE t.title='Bright Star';

--#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
SELECT title, MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
GROUP BY title, release_year
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;

--Question with #5. What is the reason for entering MIN(release_year)
--when I already order by release_year ascending and limit to first output?
