# SQL
SQL Portfolio 

Hi everyone,

Welcome to my SQL portfolio. This code repository contains examples of SQL that I have written, edited, re-edited, stared at, thrown my laptop for, and cried over. 

Feel free to take a look and let me know if you have suggestions for a developing analyst here or at https://linkedin.com/in/mcwack! 

Thanks, 

Mary
